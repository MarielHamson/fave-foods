# Best things to put in your mouth


  

Here's a list of my absolute favorite foods along with a quick description.

  

1. **Pad See Ewe** - my favorite Thai dish of all time! ![Pad See Ewe on a plate](https://www.jocooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/pad-see-ew-1.jpg  "Pad See Ewe")

2. **Bubbe's Pickles** - Available at New Seasons. They are so garlicky and sour ![Bubbe's pickles in a jar](https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/eeebc236-e444-4743-8a6c-11644cfe35ef_2.03e38cdedc9fd6353eb4ed3a4160dfcb.png  "Bubbe's finest")

3. **Egg Zeppelin** - Egg, Cheese, Pesto, sausage, some special spices. ![Egg Zeppelin](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5515d234e4b0179c6ecae61f/1530292588125-QDSE1RJGNO66QF2D8XWU/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kDHPSfPanjkWqhH6pl6g5ph7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0mwONMR1ELp49Lyc52iWr5dNb1QJw9casjKdtTg1_-y4jz4ptJBmI9gQmbjSQnNGng/FriedEgg-8-3.jpg?format=500w  "the Zep")
