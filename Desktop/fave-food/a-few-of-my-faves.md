Best things to put in your mouth

Here's a list of my absolute favorite foods along with a quick description. 

Pad See Ewe - my favorite Thai dish of all time! 
Bubbe's Pickles - Available at New Seasons. They are so garlicky and sour
Egg Zeppelin - Egg, Cheese, Pesto, some special spices. Ingredients for the best breakfast sandwich known to human.

I hope you've enjoyed this list and it inspires you to try some new things!
